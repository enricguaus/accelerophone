The Arduino scripts need the following libraries:

Wire                             (not installation required)
MMA8452_Accelerometer            https://github.com/sparkfun/MMA8452_Accelerometer

These libraries are downloaded and unzipped to:

/Volumes/Macintosh HD/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java/libraries

The *.cpp and *.h files should be directly located under the library folder (i.e. not under a "src" folder or similar)
